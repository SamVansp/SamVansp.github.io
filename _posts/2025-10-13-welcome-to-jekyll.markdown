I started this website in early october as part of my Conservation Corp of Minnesota and Iowa end of year project. It has been a fun learning expiernce to get this up and running and I hope this will serve as a neat place to see any life or professional updates that I will put up here. 

Thanks to Jekyll for making this an easy thing to set up and thank you for reading this. 

Hopefully you will see more updates here soon!
