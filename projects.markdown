    <div class="slide active" data-title="Conservation Mapping"
         data-desc="As part of my senior capstone at Macalester College I worked an internship with the nonprofit Friends of the Mississippi river. In this role my project was to develop a system to rank parcels of land in the Twin Cities metro based on their conservation potential. To do this I used GIS to calculate values that are associated with conservation outcomes such as land use, proximity to important features such as area of biodiversity significance or currently conserved land etc. I then used that data to rank the parcels by conservation potential which is now being used to prioritize land owner outreach to owners of those parcels.

    <div class="slide" data-title="Buffalo River Maps"
         data-desc="One of my first projects at the start of my term was to support my supervisor in the creation of a new Management Plan for Buffalo River State Park. This is a big deal as parks management plans are only rewritten in the event of a major change at the park and the plan for this park dates back to the park's creation in 1979. As part of this process a Citizen Advisory Committee was convened and I assisted with the running of these meetings throughout the spring and summer. I also supported the process through writing portions of the plan as well as editing of the text. My most significant contribution was the creation of the maps that would go along with this plan. Overall I created dozens of iterations of the 12 maps that would support the management plan. These included such diverse themes as topography, recreational opportunities in the surrounding area, and proposed developments in the plan. "

    <div class="slide" data-title="State Park Vehicle Counters"
         data-desc="The Parks and Trails system at the DNR currently relies on a mix of technologies to calculate visitation. I participated in the current effort to modernize the system through installation of cutting-edge vehicle counting technology in a pilot program this spring. As part of this effort I led a team in the installation of vehicle counters at 7 State Parks and Recreation Areas including a weeklong effort in which we installed counters at Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area, Zippel Bay State Park and Red River State Recreation Area. This project involved coordination and planning pre installation as well as data monitoring and validation counts after installation. I have also completed a number of solo installs of temporary counters at Flandrau and St Croix State Parks. "

    <div class="slide" data-title="Technical Writing"
         data-desc="I worked with the Parks and Trails planning team to develop the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan. This involved supporting the organization of the Steering Committee, creating graphs and doing research on demographic trends, writing two case studies and the executive summary, editing the draft, and helping to respond to the edits of the Commissioner's Office to prepare the plan for the Governor's Office and the National Park Service. This was an excellent opportunity to hone my technical writing skills, and to work through a complex process in pursuit of the publishing of a document critical to maintaining access to federal Land and Water Conservation Fund."

    <div class="slide" data-title="Accessibility Data Collection"
         data-desc="Helping visitors determine the accessibility of Parks and Trails facilities before visiting is an ongoing challenge facing the DNR. To try to combat this I have been leading an effort to collect and publicize data on the accessibility or lack of accessibility of facilities across the state so that visitors can make informed decisions about where to recreate. To do this I have created an innovative survey tool using Survey123 Connect that will allow for the streamlined collection and processing of data on 18 types of facilities from campsites to fishing piers. This project has involved the writing of the code for the survey, testing of the survey, coordination of the accessibility working group whose thoughts have informed the direction of the project as well as the creation of guides and how tos that will allow for the rollout of the tool to the entire parks and trails system. Overall this experience has given me valuable insights on project management, and the challenges of standardizing data collection on such a wide array of facilities."
