    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Macalester College in 2024, where I earned my B.A. in Environmental Studies and Data Science. While in school, I thoroughly enjoyed blending my passion for data visualization and analysis with environmental conservation and stewardship. This was exemplified by my capstone project, where I worked with <a href="https://fmr.org/updates/conservation/spring-intern-creates-strategic-land-protection-database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends of the Mississippi River</a> to identify and map high-value conservation areas across the Twin Cities region.</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>
    <p>I am currently serving as an individual placement with the Conservation Corps of Minnesota and Iowa. In this role, I work with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in the Division of Parks and Trails as a Planning and Development Specialist. I’m involved in a variety of projects, but some of my favorites include developing a survey tool to collect accessibility data at state parks, installing and validating vehicle counters across the state park and trail system, and supporting long-term planning efforts such as the Buffalo River State Park Management Plan and the State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan.</p>

    <h2>Other Intrests</h2>
    <p>I have a wide range of non-academic and professional interests. I’m an avid runner and proud Macalester Cross Country alum. I continue to pursue my love for the sport through coaching cross country and track at Saint Paul Central High School. I also have a lot of fun playing ultimate frisbee in the Twin Cities summer and fall leagues—shoutout to Discontinued! Beyond that, I enjoy a good book and a drink with friends. I’m always looking for recommendations for books or beers so please reach out with any of the above!</p>
